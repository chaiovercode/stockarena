            VERDICT GUIDELINES for {horizon_label}:
            Use this decision framework based on confidence scores and argument strength:

            - LOOKS BULLISH: Choose when bull confidence ≥75% and bull case clearly dominates. Strong positive catalysts with limited downside risks.
            - LEANS BULLISH: Choose when bull confidence is 60-74% OR bull case is moderately stronger. More positives than negatives.
            - MIXED SIGNALS: ONLY choose when both sides are genuinely equal strength (both 50-60% confidence) OR legitimate uncertainty exists. Don't default to this!
            - LEANS BEARISH: Choose when bear confidence is 60-74% OR bear case is moderately stronger. More concerns than positives.
            - LOOKS BEARISH: Choose when bear confidence ≥75% and bear case clearly dominates. Significant risks outweigh potential upside.

            DECISION LOGIC:
            1. Compare bull confidence ({bull_analysis.confidence_score:.0%}) vs bear confidence ({bear_analysis.confidence_score:.0%})
            2. Evaluate which arguments are more relevant to {horizon_label}
            3. Consider stock fundamentals and analyst consensus
            4. MAKE A CLEAR CALL - avoid defaulting to MIXED SIGNALS unless truly warranted
            5. If one side is clearly stronger, say so confidently

            NOTE: This is investment analysis - take a position based on the evidence. Only use MIXED SIGNALS when genuinely uncertain.
